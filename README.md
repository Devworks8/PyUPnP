PyUPnP
======

Simple Python UPnP device library built in Twisted

**NOTE:** PyUPnP doesn't implement ContentDirectory, ConnectionManager, etc.. services.
We do provide the shell classes with the actions, state variables and methods which you
can extend to implement the services yourself.

See https://github.com/fuzeman/PyUPnP/blob/master/examples/mediaserver/main.py
for an example of how to get started.
